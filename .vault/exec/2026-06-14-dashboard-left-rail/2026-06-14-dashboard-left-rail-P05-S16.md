<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace dashboard-left-rail with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S16 and 2026-06-14-dashboard-left-rail-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path.

# Prove the read-only law has no fetch or mutation escape hatch in the rail

## Scope

- `frontend/src/app/left/`

## Description

- Add read-only-law assertions in `LeftRail.render.test`: scan every rail button for forbidden git/disk/vault mutation vocabulary (none present) and assert a filter change issues no wire request (transport spy).

## Outcome

The read-only law has no fetch or mutation escape hatch in the rail; committed and green.

## Notes

The no-wire assertion spies the real transport across a filter change; the mutation scan covers every button accessible name.
