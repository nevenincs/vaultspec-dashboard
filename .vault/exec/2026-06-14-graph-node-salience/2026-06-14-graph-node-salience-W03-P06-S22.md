<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace graph-node-salience with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S22 and 2026-06-14-graph-node-salience-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# Define the Lens enum and per-lens parameter rows (teleport bias, dominant centrality, type-prior weights, recency emphasis, lifecycle modulation) with status as the default

## Scope

- `engine/crates/engine-query/src/salience.rs`

## Description

<!-- Succinct line-by-line list of steps executed. Use imperative language, mirroring git commit summary lines. -->

## Outcome

Defined the Lens enum (Design, Status with Status the #[default]) and the per-lens parameter rows: teleport_bias (per authority class), type_prior (per authority class), and weights() (the WeightRow: type-prior/centrality/recency/role/burst/focus-gamma/betweenness-blend/half-life). Lens::parse defaults to status.

## Notes

<!-- Incidents. Data loss. Difficulties; persistent failures. Skipped work. Scaffolds left in code. Failures. -->
