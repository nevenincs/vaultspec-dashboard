<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace graph-node-salience with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S02 and 2026-06-14-graph-node-salience-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

# Define the tier-weight vector (declared >= structural >> temporal >= semantic) and build the weighted backbone adjacency over the bounded subgraph from the LinkageGraph

## Scope

- `engine/crates/engine-query/src/salience.rs`

## Description

<!-- Succinct line-by-line list of steps executed. Use imperative language, mirroring git commit summary lines. -->

## Outcome

Defined the tier-weight vector (declared 1.0 >= structural 0.9 >> temporal 0.3 >= semantic 0.15) and Backbone::build, which folds the bounded member subgraph into an undirected tier-weighted adjacency. Only edges among served members are admitted.

Defined tier_weight (declared 1.0 >= structural 0.9 >> temporal 0.3 >= semantic 0.15) and Backbone::build, which folds the bounded member subgraph into an undirected tier-weighted adjacency. Membership-bounded: only edges among served members are admitted.

## Notes

<!-- Incidents. Data loss. Difficulties; persistent failures. Skipped work. Scaffolds left in code. Failures. -->
